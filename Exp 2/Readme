In this experiment we created a basic html card in which the balance , deposit and withdraw options can be seen.

while making the html of rthe card , we tried keeping the different components in the different div's and named them
so that it becomes easier to add CSS on them.

in total we created 4 div's , in first the outterarea which is to be kept of greyish colour and it contains all 
other div's in it 

further we created the inner area div which contiains all the card elements 

then we created the div in which the balance is written 

at last we created the buttons div which contains 2 buttons deposit and withdraw

********************* NOW IN CSS FILE ********************

at first we have given the styling to the complete body which means this properties will be applied to every 
element that is present in the body tag 

we added the background colour and display flex , justify content , align items to keep the content in the
center of the page 

further in  the innerarea we added the different css 

in which bg is white and the border radius is used to keep the corners rounded and box shadow is used to add the shadow
effect so that the card can be differentiated

now we gace the css to the balance div to add the colour to it , size of the text and the margin 

at last we added the css to the buttons div 

where we gave the similar properties to both the button using (.buttons button) 
 and then we used the same properties that we earlier used like border radius , width , padding and display

now we need to just chnage the color of the buttoms ,  then we will used the button name to chnage the color like
deposit will be of green color anjf withdraw will be of red color
