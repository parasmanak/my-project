Banking UI Design using HTML and CSS:

1.I made a simple web page that looks like a small banking screen.

It shows:

	1.A balance (starts at $2000)

	2.Two buttons – one for Deposit and one for Withdraw

2.I wrote the layout using HTML, and the design using CSS.

3.I linked an external CSS file (Experiment_2.css) to style everything.

4.I used flexbox in CSS to center everything in the middle of the page.

5.I gave the balance green color and big size so it stands out.

6.I styled the Deposit button in green and the Withdraw button in red.

7.I also added a hover effect – when you move your mouse over the buttons, the color gets a bit darker and the text turns black.
8.Also make the page responsive.
