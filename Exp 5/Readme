EXPERIMENT-5 [LISTING THE PRODUCTS AND FILTERING THEM]



This webpage is designed to show a list of products that can be filtered dynamically using a dropdown menu.
1. Overall Structure:
The page contains a heading titled "Product List".
Below the heading, there is a dropdown menu labeled "Filter by Category".
The dropdown has four options: All, Clothing, Electronics, and Books.
Beneath the dropdown, a product list area displays items based on the chosen filter.

2.Products Data
The products are stored in an array, where each product has two properties:
A name (e.g., T-Shirt, Jeans, Headphones).
A category (Clothing, Electronics, or Books).
The categories determine which items appear when filtering.

3. CSS Styling
The page uses Arial font for a clean look.
The container (holding everything) has a black border, padding, and centered layout.
The heading is styled with a large font size.
The dropdown has padding and a green border.
Each product item is displayed inside a box with a pink border, padding, margin, and rounded corners to make it visually distinct.

4. JavaScript Functionality
When the page loads, all products are displayed initially.
A function is used to create and display products inside the product list area. It clears any old items first and then adds new ones.
An event listener is attached to the dropdown menu. Whenever the user changes the selection:
If All is chosen, every product is displayed.
If a specific category is chosen (e.g., Clothing), only the products belonging to that category are displayed.
The filtering happens instantly, without reloading the page, using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

5. User Experience
The user sees a clean, styled box with a dropdown and products.
By changing the filter, they can quickly narrow down products to the desired category.
This makes the interface interactive, responsive, and user-friendly.
